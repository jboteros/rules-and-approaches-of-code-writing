### Global State Managers for React Native

Global state managers in React Native are tools or libraries that allow the handling and sharing of state across different components throughout an application, regardless of the component tree hierarchy. They are essential for larger applications where passing state from parents to children or between unrelated components can become complex and hard to maintain.

#### Redux
Redux is one of the most popular libraries for global state management. It uses a single store that contains all the application's state, and its architecture is based on immutable principles and predictable actions.

- **Pros:**
  - Predictable and maintainable.
  - Large ecosystem and many available middlewares.
  - Strong developer tools.

- **Cons:**
  - Steep learning curve.
  - Can be overkill for small applications.

#### Context API
The Context API is part of React and provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.

- **Pros:**
  - No additional libraries required.
  - Simpler integration compared to other solutions.

- **Cons:**
  - Might be less optimal for frequent updates or very large states.

#### MobX
MobX focuses on reactive programming by making state observable and automatically updating subscribed components when there are changes to that state.

- **Pros:**
  - Simpler and less boilerplate than Redux.
  - Efficient and automatic reactivity.

- **Cons:**
  - The 'magical' approach to reactivity might be confusing for new developers.

#### Recoil
Recoil is a state management library designed for React and offers a more straightforward way to manage shared state with an API similar to React's useState hook.

- **Pros:**
  - Maintains many of React's conventions, so it's easy to learn if you're already familiar with hooks.
  - Good performance with memoization and optimized component subscriptions.

- **Cons:**
  - Still relatively new and doesn't have as large a user base as Redux or MobX.

#### Zustand
Zustand is a small library that simplifies state management and allows working with stores easily, without the need for reducers or actions, much like working with `useState`.

- **Pros:**
  - Easy to use and set up with a minimal API.
  - Doesnâ€™t enforce strict architecture or patterns.

- **Cons:**
  - Although flexible, lacks the strong ecosystem and established tools of Redux.

Each state manager has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on the size of the application, the specific requirements of the project, and the development team's familiarity with the tool.
