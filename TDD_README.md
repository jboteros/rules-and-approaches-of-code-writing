# Test-Driven Development (TDD)
is a software development approach where you write a test before you write the corresponding piece of code. Here's a basic explanation of the process:

- **Write a test**: Start by writing a test for a functionality that doesn't exist yet. This test should fail because the functionality isn't implemented.

- **Write the code**: Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass. The code doesn't have to be perfect; it just needs to pass the test.

- **Refactor**: Clean up the code while ensuring that the tests still pass. This might involve removing duplication, improving readability, or making other changes that don't affect the behavior of the code.

The cycle then repeats with a new test. This approach has several benefits, including ensuring that all code is covered by tests, making the code more maintainable, and helping to prevent bugs.
